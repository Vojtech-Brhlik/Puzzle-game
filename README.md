Project made for local scouts group for some teambuilding.

Players are (in-real-life, IRL) split into red and blue teams. 
players are shown a terminal and they're tasked to communicate with it, after succesfully finding the password (hidden IRL in a given space), 
they need to find ciphers (IRL), decipher them and give according answers to the terminal. 

If a team gives all answers to the terminal, the team wins and a trophy is displayed in the terminal. After that, the game ends.

Due to the nature of the answers, program does not check if the answers are correct - in my case, the questions required some 
kind of empathy and belief, so there are no objectively wrong/correct answers.
